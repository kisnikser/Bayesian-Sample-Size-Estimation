 abstract = {Three different Bayesian approaches to sample size calculations based on highest posterior density (HPD) intervals are discussed and illustrated in the context of a binomial experiment. The preposterior marginal distribution of the data is used to find the sample size needed to attain an expected HPD coverage probability for a given fixed interval length. Alternatively, one can find the sample size required to attain an expected HPD interval length for a fixed coverage. These two criteria can lead to different sample size requirements. In addition to averaging, a worst possible outcome scenario is also considered. The results presented here provide an exact solution to a problem recently addressed in the literature.},

abstract = {Abstract Sample size estimation is a major component of the design of virtually every experiment in medicine. Prudent use of the available prior information is a crucial element of experimental planning. Most sample size formulae in current use employ this information only in the form of point estimates, even though it is usually more accurately expressed as a distribution over a range of values. In this paper, we review several Bayesian and mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches to sample size calculations based on lengths and coverages of posterior credible intervals. We apply these approaches to the design of an experiment to estimate the difference between two binomial proportions, and we compare results to those derived from standard formulae. Consideration of several criteria can contribute to selection of a final sample size. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
